\begin{abstract}
  Forecasters have long known that rapid changes in tropical cyclones (TC) motion occur during interaction with extratropical wavetrains. While TC speed has received much attention in the past, acceleration has not. Here, using a large data sample, we formally examine the synoptic-scale patterns associated with  tangential and normal components of TC acceleration. During periods of rapid acceleration, the large-scale flow consists of a developing wavepacket in the extratropics, with the storm straddled between an upstream trough and downstream ridge. This pattern is consistent with the process of extratropical transition (ET) of TCs. In contrast, during near-zero or rapid deceleration, the extratropical wavepacket remains poleward, with a ridge  located directly north of the storm center.  On average, the tangential acceleration peaks about 18 hours prior to the ET designation. The curvature acceleration increases before ET and stabilizes thereafter.
%
 We also find a robust decrease in the annually averaged values of rapid acceleration over the past 38 years within the latitude band most commonly associated with ET over the Atlantic. Consequently, we hypothesize that trends in rapid acceleration can be used as an independent metric to assess changes in the extratropical stormtrack activity that mediate ET.

\introduction  %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]
A tropical cyclone (TC), to a leading order, can abstracted as a nearly isolated vortex embedded in an external flow. From this view, its motion is primarily controlled by the large scale steering current. Secondary effects on TC motion involve interactions with the background vertical wind shear and potential vorticity gradients. The former influences the generation of new convection and redevelopment of the TC. The latter relates to Rossby wave dispersion that leads to the formation of the so-called $\beta$-gyres and nonlinear advection. As noted by \cite{E2018}, steady progress has been made in our understanding of TC motion and this is reflected in our ability to forecast their tracks. 


\section{data}


We used the IBTrACS v4 \citep{KnappIBTRaCS} data for track information. We did not apply a threshold for maximum sustained winds, but discarded all storms that lasted less than two days. Selected atmospheric fields are taken from the the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting's (ECMWF) ERA-Interim reanalysis \citep[ERAI; ][]{DUS11}. To ascertain whether a tropical storm underwent ET, we use the \emph{nature} designation in the IBTraCS database which relies on the judgement of the forecasters of the agency responsible for the ocean basin. For the North Atlantic basin, this designation made by the US national hurricane center (NHC) is available for the entire period considered here. While compiling ET statistics, we only consider cases where the storm nature designation switched from TS to ET at least once during its lifetime.

TEXT


\subsubsection{Tangential and curvature acceleration}
At any location along a TC track, the acceleration of a fluid element moving with the center of a TC can be written as:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{a} = \frac{dV}{dt} \mathbf{\hat{s}} + \frac{V^2}{R} \mathbf{\hat{n}} 
    \label{eq:acc}
\end{equation}

Where V is the forward speed and R is the radius of curvature of the track at that location. Here $\mathbf{\hat{s}}$ and $\mathbf{\hat{n}}$ are unit vectors in this \emph{natural coordinate} system. The former is directed along the TC motion. The latter is normal to the local tangent and aligned along the radius of curvature.  The first term in equation \ref{eq:acc} is the tangential acceleration and the second is the curvature or normal acceleration. The tangential speed V at any track location (given by index j)  is calculated as:
